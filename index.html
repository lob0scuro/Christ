            In a small village in the middle east, circa 3 A.D. there was a
            young couple who were engaged to be married. Having no relations,
            the girl found herself with child. The man must have been heart
            broken, disgusted, irrate! and the girl... fearful, but at peace.
            Why? Later that night, Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came
            to him and said <blockquote cite="https://biblehub.com/nasb_/matthew/1.htm"><q>Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary
            as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the
            Holy Spirit. She will bear a son; and you shall call His name Jesus,
            for He will save the people from their sins.</q></blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Joseph had a choice. Dwell on the hurt, secretly send her away to
            avoid public shaming, or trust in God. Joseph chose to trust in Him
            and took Mary as his wife. Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethelehem
            (Joseph's town of origin) and found last minute lodging in a stable
            behind an Inn, just as Mary was giving birth. way up in the sky
            above them, a star broke out of the darkness and began to shine
            brighter than any of it's contemporaries. It was a sign of hope. But
            for some, it was a threat. Herod (then Ruler of Judea) inquired
            about the star and what it meant, and he wasn't pleased with the
            answer he got. <a href="">Click here</a> to learn about his response

              My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
              my Saviour.
              For he hath regarded the lowliness of his handmaiden. For behold,
              from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. And his
              mercy is on them that fear him throughout all generations.
              He hath shewed strength with his arm. He hath scattered the proud
              in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty
              from their seat and hath exalted the humble and meek.
              He hath filled the hungry with good things. And the rich he hath
              sent empty away. He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant
              Israel as he promised to our forefathers Abraham, and his seed
              forever. Amen.
